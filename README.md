# Big Picture Portfolio

Let's create a portfolio website with Bootstrap! The only custom CSS you might need is for the big image.

Take a look at the examples:

Desktop:

![Example desktop](example-portfolio-desktop.jpg)

Tablet:

![Example tablet](example-portfolio-tablet.jpg)

Mobile:

![Example mobile](example-portfolio-mobile.png)

## Extra:

- What else can you add to optimize this site for seach engines?
- The image included in the `images` folder is quite big - how can you improve this?
- Can you deploy this site to Github Pages? If you do, add the link to repo description.
